Logging and Alarms
==================

Heartbeat
---------

Heartbeat signals should be sent as a POST request to `snopl.us/monitoring/heartbeat`
every five seconds with the name of the program and its status. For example::

    $ curl --data "name=builder&status=ok" -u snoplus snopl.us/monitoring/heartbeat

Logging
-------

Logging messages should be sent as a POST request to `snopl.us/monitoring/log`
with the name of the program, the level of the message, and the message. For
example::

    $ curl --data "name=builder&level=20&message=info" -u snoplus snopl.us/monitoring/log

An optional argument `notify` will cause the message to appear as an alert on
the monitoring page. For example::

    $ curl --data "name=builder&level=20&message=info&notify" -u snoplus snopl.us/monitoring/log

.. note::

    Alarms will expire from the monitoring site after 24 hours, although they will
    still appear in the log file saved to disk (``/var/log/snoplus/[name].log``).

Alarm levels >= 40 will automatically trigger an alarm.

Logging from Python
-------------------

With the module `monitor <https://github.com/tlatorre-uchicago/minard/blob/master/bin/monitor.py>`_,
you can log to the monitoring server using the python `logging <https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html>`_ module
and post a heartbeat signal every five seconds::

    import logging
    import monitor

    host = 'snopl.us'
    name = 'example'
    auth = 'snoplus', 'password'

    # this will start a new thread which posts
    # the heartbeat signal automatically every
    # five seconds until the main thread ends
    monitor.post_heartbeat(host, name, auth)
    monitor.set_up_root_logger(host, name, auth)

    logging.info("info")
    # you can create an alert on the monitoring site like this
    logging.info("info",extra=monitor.NOTIFY)

Logging from C (libcurl)
